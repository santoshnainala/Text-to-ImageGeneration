# Text-to-ImageGeneration
This project focuses on building a Text-to-Image Generation pipeline using Stable Diffusion, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The pipeline allows for text-to-image generation, image analysis using CLIP, and image segmentation using SAM2, all accessible via a FastAPI web service.
